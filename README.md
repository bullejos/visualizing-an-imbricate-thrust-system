### We use Python to visualize an imbricate thrust system: Palomeque Duplex (SE, Spain)

In this repository we introduce a Python application for visualizing an imbricate thrust system. The application uses the traditional geologic information to create a HTML geological map with real topography and a set of geological cross-sections with the essential structural and stratigraphic elements. On the basis of the high geological knowledge gained during the last three decades, the Pal- omeque sheets affecting the Cenozoic Malaguide Succession in the Internal Betic Zone (SE Spain) was selected to show the application. In this area, a Malaguide Cretaceous to lower Miocene Succession is deformed as an imbricate thrust system with two thrusts forming a duplex affected later by three faults with a main slipstrike kinematic. The modeled elements match well with the design of the stratigraphic intervals and the structures reported in recent scientific publications. This proves the good performance of this Python application for visualizing the structural and stratigraphic architecture.

## How to use

### Download the code

The code can be found in the repository, it can be downloaded as ZIP by clicking in the green Code button. The necessary file is the notebook visualizing_an_imbricate_thrust_system.ipynb. In this notebook we use libraries and packages like: plotlib, matplotli, pandas, numpy, sympy, etc. that are included at the begining. But we also use the file bezier.py from the repository https://github.com/torresjrjr/Bezier.py.

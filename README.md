### We use Python to visualize an imbricate thrust system: Palomeque Duplex (SE, Spain)

In this repository we introduce a Python application for visualizing an imbricate thrust system. The application uses the traditional geologic information to create a HTML geological map with real topography and a set of geological cross-sections with the essential structural and stratigraphic elements. On the basis of the high geological knowledge gained during the last three decades, the Palomeque sheets affecting the Cenozoic Malaguide Succession in the Internal Betic Zone (SE Spain) was selected to show the application. In this area, a Malaguide Cretaceous to lower Miocene Succession is deformed as an imbricate thrust system with two thrusts forming a duplex affected later by three faults with a main slipstrike kinematic. The modeled elements match well with the design of the stratigraphic intervals and the structures reported in recent scientific publications. This proves the good performance of this Python application for visualizing the structural and stratigraphic architecture.

## How to use 

### html files

The html files hosted in the repository are too large to open here, so download and open them locally on your computer.
The file `visualizing an imbricate thrust system.html` is an html translation of the notebook `visualizing an imbricate thrust system.html`.ipynb`. We include this file here in case you want to see the process without running the code.


### Download the code

The code can be found in the repository, it can be downloaded as ZIP by clicking in the green Code button. The necessary file is the notebook `visualizing_an_imbricate_thrust_system.ipynb`. In this notebook we use libraries and packages like: plotlib, matplotli, pandas, numpy, sympy, etc. that are included at the begining. But we also use the file bezier.py from the repository https://github.com/torresjrjr/Bezier.py. This file is also hosted here.

### How to run the notebook

You can run the notebook in [Jupyter-Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you also need a Python kernel installed in your computer. We recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and launching Jupyter by typing `jupyter-notebook` in the Anaconda Prompt.

To successfully run the notebook, you need to locate it in the same folder as the `data` directory and the file `bezier.py`. In order to do this, you may just extract the ZIP file with the whole repository. Then, launch Jupyter Notebook and select the notebook  `visualizing_an_imbricate_thrust_system.ipynb`. To run a cell, you can just click in the run button (next to the cell number) or click on it and press Ctrl+Enter. You're now ready to go!
